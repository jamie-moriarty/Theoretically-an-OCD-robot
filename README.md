# Theoretically-an-OCD-robot
Using OpenCV and Python 3 with a Raspberry Pi to create a robot that finds a yellow ball and puts it on a green platform. 

Check out the video here: https://youtu.be/N7MrAUGBYeU

The idea was that the robot would pick up the yellow ball and put it on the green can, but the ball would always fall off and the cycle would continue. 
More code needs to be added to fix some bugs and also to tell the robot to roam until it finds the yellow ball after completing the task. Right now it can only find things currently in the camera vision. And also the battery is too heavy for the motors which is why I am holding it in the video. It mostly works!

Using a Raspberry Pi 3 with OpenCV 3 and Python 3. Hardware includes an Adafruit PWM servo driver hat, 2 continuous rotation servos with wheels, 1 continuous rotation servo for the forklift, some snap action switches and some other hand made structures. The body is made from corrugated pastic and hot glue. Lots of hot glue.
